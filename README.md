bamlssAPI is a convenient API which simplifies the implementation of new
samplers for bamlss models. This package is based on the bamlss package
for estimating Bayesian distributional regression models, also known as
generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS).

## Installation

You can install the development version of bamlssAPI from GitHub by running:

```r
if (!("devtools" %in% installed.packages()[, "Package"])) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("hriebl/bamlssAPI")
```

## Examples

For some usage examples, see the
